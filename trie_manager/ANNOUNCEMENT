sks-1.0.5 is released!

There are a number of big changes from 1.0.4.  Here are the main ones:

- SKS supports indexing by subkey keyids!

- The SKS executables have been merged into one, improving maintainability.

  this is an important one for current SKS admins.  sks_recon, sks_db,
  sks_fastbuild, etc, are all gone.  There are only two executables, sks, and
  sks_add_mail, which is a simple script used for getting incoming emails via
  procmail.  All other functions are invoked via sks.  You can see the
  various options of sks by typing "sks help".
  
  You can upgrade your existing SKS installation with "sks update_subkeys".
  Note that this will take a while, and you must shut down your server during
  the update process.  

  WARNING!  Make sure you delete the old executables, as they won't be
  overwritten when you install the new version.

- (Untested) support for running "sks db" on two ports simultaneously.  This
  is useful for servers that want to be available on port 80 (to allow
  access through firewalls) and on port 11371, to allow tools like GPG to
  access the server.
