   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to sduds's documentation!
=================================

*SDUDS* is short for "synchronizing Diaspora user directory server". It accepts URLs of webfinger profiles that should be retrieved and added to the directory, has searching functionality and synchronizes with other servers to provide decentralicity. The efficient synchronization algorithm is stolen from the `SKS OpenPHP key server`_.
