* Some keyids don't come up when they should.
  The following link comes up when you look for "minsky", but the link itself
  doesn't work.

* GPG querying is broken:

      $ gpg --keyserver sks.dnsalias.net --recv-key 8B4CBC9C
      gpg: requesting key 8B4CBC9C from HKP keyserver sks.dnsalias.net
      gpg: [fd 3]: read error: Connection reset by peer
      gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
      gpg: premature eof while reading hashed signature data
      gpg: key 8B4CBC9C: not changed
      gpg: Total number processed: 1
      gpg:              unchanged: 1
