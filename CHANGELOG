1.0.5:
  - subkey indexing added
  - removal of most executables.  Now single "sks" executable used for almost
    everything.
  - Numerix tarball updated to include GPL notices in each file
  - SKS files updated to include GPL notices in each file
  - SKS can be configured to listen to two ports for HKP access.

1.0.3: added simple built-in webserver so that index page can be served by
       sks_db.  This should make it easier to put sks on port 80.  Also,
       sks can now be launched from any directory, as long as the -basedir
       command-line option is used to specify the location of the sks
       directory. 

1.0.2: Serious database corruption bug in fastbuild and build fixed.  Also,
       client.ml modified to avoid Yet Another Deadlock Bug. 

(...many versions skipped...)

0.1.3: Added interoperability with PKS-style email synchronization, plus
       numerous bugfixes.

0.1.2: Omitted key fix from above upload having to do with key fetching
       post-reconciliation.   Key fetching should work now.

0.1.1: Fixed HTML response pages to work better with GPG and other automated
       systems.  Also some Makefile fixes and documentation updates.

0.1.0: Initial public release
